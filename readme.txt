Final Project Site

Here are your requirements:

    No project should have fewer than three pages or discrete, well-organized, useful content areas. What's a "discrete content area"? For our purposes, this means at least enough content to fill an average laptop's browser window--more is okay, less not so much. These content areas can be part of one or more scrollable pages (as an example, note the large content areas that appear one at a time as you scroll down the home page of https://www.unc.edu/), separated into separate html documents/pages, or a combination of the two. Note that these content areas are in addition to--not including--your header, footer, and navigation menu, since those things are about your site's overall usability scheme, not part of its actual content.
    If you're working with a group, each team member must produce at least two unique content areas, to be arranged and documented in advance.
    Your website or app must be mobile-first and fully responsive.
    You must include a navigation menu through which users can access the pages or content areas within the project.
    Your project's file structure must be set up and organized according to the best practices we've discussed in class.
    Class and ID names must be semantic and appropriate.
    All HTML and CSS must validate per W3C standards. 
    You must create your project's layout with CSS grid properties, flexbox properties, or a combination of the two. Do not download a template from the Internet and submit part or all of it with a few minor modifications. This will be considered plagiarism and reported to the Honor Court accordingly.
    All text must be written by either you or your client (no borrowing filler text from the Internet).
    No copyright violations: images and media must come from the public domain, be Creative Commons or otherwise licensed for reuse and sharing, or you must give credit to the original author of the media item you plan to use.
    There should be no broken links or missing images.
    HTML5 structural-semantic elements should be used instead of generic divs when appropriate, but divs are fine to use, too.
    Site follows accessibility guidelines and considers the needs of users with restrictions such as visual impairments or mobility restrictions, as well as anyone using assistive technologies to access the Internet: e.g., images include alt tags, all :hover pseudoclasses have corresponding :focus pseudoclasses, all contrast ratios pass at at least for the WCAG AA level to ensure readability (you can test this with tools like this one).
    The site must be deployed live on the Internet. We'll discuss this further in class.
